This directory contains files that implement in SCM Scheme, a simple
evaluator, online partial evaluator, and offline partial evaluator for
the language FCL.

The implementations are based on the notes "An introduction to
partial evaluation using a simple flowchart language" from
the 1998 DIKU Summer School on Partial Evaluation.

Files:

  parse.scm -- implements parsing, unparsing, and a procedure to
               collect all variables appearing in an FCL program.
  eval.scm  -- the interpreter
  online.scm -- the online PE
  offline.scm -- the offline PE
  lib-fcl-shared.scm -- help procedures used by evaluator and PE's such as
           system constants (initial store value, etc.),
           definitions of state data structures
           procedures for evaluation of primitives
           procedures that simply getting and putting objects to a file
           common list functions (e.g., foldr and friends)
           static/dynamic tags for PE's
           label management for residual programs
  lib-table.scm -- implements a table ADT used to represent stores,
           divisions, blockmaps, etc.
  lib-set.scm   -- implements a set ADT used for the seen set.
  lib-pending.scm -- implements the pending list

Subdirectories
  examples -- contains examples from the text and others used
           for debugging.
  outputs  -- use this for the results of specialization


Here are some examples for running the systems.  The transcript
below starts from the UNIX prompt.  However, I recommend that
you use EMACS and run SCM inside a shell in EMACS.  See the
web page for how to set that up.

The user supplies a list of the static parameter names (e.g., '(n)) as
well as the static values (e.g., '(2)).  This will specialize the
power program to the exponent value 2.  Here the residual program is
displayed, plus it is written to the file "outputs/power-2.fcl".

Now we can run the residual program.

This works the same as online.

etc.

There are a couple of extra procedures in the offline case that
allow you to see the intermediate results of division and
annotated program.

The procedures take a parsed program as input, so we have to
fetch the program and parse it manually.

get-file-object is defined in lib-fcl-shared.scm.  It just
reads a single object from a file.


For each of the top-level calls above, there are versions that
do not read from files (e.g., eval-fcl, online, offline).

**** Note: **** Finally, when switching between eval, online, and
offline, you should always reload the files from disk to be safe ---
some procedure names are not unique (I haven't been able to track
these down yet).
