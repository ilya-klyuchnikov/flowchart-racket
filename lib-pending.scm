;;  Implements the pending set used by both the online and offline
;;  partial evaluators.  We use an ADT for the pending so that
;;  we can switch between depth-first and bread-first specialization
;;  without modifying the specializer.
;;
;;  The pending set is implemented using a list.  For depth-first
;;  specialization, items are retrieved in a LIFO (stack-like)
;;  manner.  For breadth-first, it is FIFO (queue-like).  Modify
;;  the add-pending procedures below to switch between LIFO and FIFO.
